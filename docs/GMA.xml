Children aged two and three recently tragically died after being locked inside a parked car in Angeles City, Pampanga. To prevent such tragedies, here are some important safety measures that can be taken:

2. Never leave children unattended in a car, even for a short period of time. 
3. Keep car keys out of reach of children to prevent them from accidentally locking themselves inside the car. 
4. Install child safety locks on car doors to prevent children from opening them from the inside. 
5. Make it a habit to always check the backseat of your car before locking it, to ensure no child is left behind. By following these simple safety precautions, we can help prevent tragic accidents like the one that occurred in Angeles City.

Canada's population reached a record high of 40.77 million in 2023, with a significant increase driven by temporary immigration. The country saw a growth of 1.27 million people, marking a 3.2% increase from the previous year and the highest growth rate since 1957. This surge in population can be attributed to the influx of immigrants coming to Canada. In recent years, Canada has been welcoming a large number of temporary immigrants, contributing to the overall population growth. This demographic shift has implications for various sectors such as healthcare, housing, and labor market. As Canada continues to attract immigrants, it is expected that the population will continue to grow steadily in the coming years, potentially leading to further changes in the country's social and economic landscape.

Summary:
The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority announced that the number coding scheme in Metro Manila will be lifted earlier than scheduled for Holy Week.

This proactive measure is expected to benefit the public and facilitate easier movement around the metro during the festive period. By lifting the number coding scheme earlier, the MMDA demonstrates flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of the community during important occasions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
