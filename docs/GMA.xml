Canada's population reached a record high of 40.77 million in 2023, with a significant increase driven by temporary immigration. The country saw a growth of 1.27 million people, marking a 3.2% increase from the previous year and the highest growth rate since 1957. This surge in population can be attributed to the influx of immigrants coming to Canada. In recent years, Canada has been welcoming a large number of temporary immigrants, contributing to the overall population growth. This demographic shift has implications for various sectors such as healthcare, housing, and labor market. As Canada continues to attract immigrants, it is expected that the population will continue to grow steadily in the coming years, potentially leading to further changes in the country's social and economic landscape.

During a random drug test at the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX), two bus drivers tested positive for shabu. The incident highlights the importance of conducting regular drug testing to ensure the safety of passengers and road users. The use of illegal drugs by public transport drivers poses a serious risk to the public and must be addressed promptly. Authorities at PITX must take immediate action to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the enforcement of strict anti-drug policies. This serves as a reminder of the dangers of drug use in the transportation sector and the need for vigilance in maintaining a drug-free workplace. The drivers who tested positive for shabu should be subjected to appropriate disciplinary actions, and measures should be put in place to deter others from engaging in similar behavior. Transit safety is paramount, and all efforts must be made to uphold high standards of professionalism among drivers operating in public transport systems.
