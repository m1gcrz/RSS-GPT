<br />
Two Japanese nationals, alleged members of the criminal group "Luffy" and accused of committing various crimes in Japan, have been deported by the Bureau of Immigration. The individuals were part of the notorious group involved in illegal activities in their home country. The BI took action against them for their alleged involvement in a string of criminal acts. They were deported back to Japan to face charges and prosecution for their crimes. Japan's authorities had been pursuing the individuals for their illicit activities and sought their extradition. The deportation of the two individuals is a significant victory for both countries in the fight against transnational criminal organizations. The BI's swift action in deporting the accused members demonstrates strong cooperation between the Philippines and Japan in combating cross-border crimes. This development sends a clear message that criminal activities will not be tolerated, and law enforcement agencies will work together to bring perpetrators to justice.
